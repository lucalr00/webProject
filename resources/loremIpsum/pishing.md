Phishing Awareness: Protecting Your Online Security
What is Phishing?
Phishing is a malicious attempt to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details, by posing as a trustworthy entity. Cybercriminals often use fake emails, messages, or websites to trick users into disclosing confidential information.

How to Recognize Phishing Attempts
1. Check the Sender's Details:
Verify the sender's email address. Legitimate organizations use official domain names. Be cautious of slight misspellings or unfamiliar addresses.

2. Watch for Urgency and Fear Tactics:
Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt quick actions. Be skeptical of messages that demand immediate attention or threaten consequences.

3. Examine URLs Carefully:
Hover over links to preview the actual URL before clicking. Legitimate websites use secure connections (https://) and have URLs that match the official site.

4. Review Email Content:
Be wary of unexpected attachments or requests for sensitive information via email. Legitimate organizations usually do not request such details through email.

5. Verify Communication Channels:
If in doubt, use official communication channels to verify the authenticity of requests. Contact the organization directly using trusted contact information.

What to Do if You Suspect Phishing
1. Do Not Click on Suspicious Links:
Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. If unsure, independently navigate to the official website.

2. Report Suspected Phishing:
Forward phishing emails to [your@email.com] and [your IT support team]. Reporting helps in taking necessary measures and protecting others.

3. Update Passwords:
If you've fallen victim to a phishing attempt, change your passwords immediately. Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts.

4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Enhance your account security by enabling 2FA wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.
